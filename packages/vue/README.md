UpSet.js is a JavaScript reimplementation of [UpSetR](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/UpSetR/) which itself is based on [UpSet](http://vcg.github.io/upset/about/). The library is written in React. This repository contains a bundled version of it that has no dependencies and uses [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) in the background.

A detailed description can be found at the README on the main [Github Monorepo](https://github.com/upsetjs/upsetjs).
